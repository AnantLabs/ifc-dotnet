# Road Map #

## Required for Ifc compatibility ##
  * Unit Tests and integration tests for everything
  * [Implementation of all Rules](ImplementingRules.md)
  * Implementing all functions (see Issue tracker)
  * Implementing all DERIVE properties
  * IFC2X4 when it is released properly.

## Nice to haves ##
  * Refactoring of spaghetti code
  * Full unit testing of rules
  * large scale tests
  * parallelisation of serialization/deserialization (particularly linking references in the STEPserializer)
  * parallelisation of rule engine

## Possible New Features ##
  * Integration with NHibernate
  * .Net BimServer client
  * JsonSerializer (under development)
  * full COM compatibility
  * Excel add-in
